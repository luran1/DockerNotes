##Dockerfiles are instructions for docker that allows it to create a container to your exact specifications. a good way to think of it is a instalation plan for the container.

##A Dockerfile can be created from a simple text file that has the correct commands for your specific need. the commands for a Dockerfile can be found on another file under notes speaking of how to write a Dockerfile.
